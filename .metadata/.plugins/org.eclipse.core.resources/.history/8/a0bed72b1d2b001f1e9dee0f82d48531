LandingPageStepdefintion 
OfferPageStepDefintion

-Cucumber dependency Injection - import Pico container dependency
Create a class and declare the Variables/Objects that are going to be shared across various step Definition files
WebDriver driver;
Create a constructor in the step Definition classes and use this keyword to initialize the variable
	public LandingPageStepDefinition(TestContextSetup TestContextSetup)
	{
		this.TestContextSetup=TestContextSetup;
	}

in the step Definition class use TestContextSetup.driver.findElements

-classes losely coupled so that maintaince work is less and that code can be reused

-break down actions into methods which can be used across 

-use pageobject models

-for every page create a separate java class
under that seprate java class declare all the locators using @FindBy - pageFactoryInitelements
or like this 

By search = findElement(By.cssSelector("input[type='search']");
then use search in your action methods
